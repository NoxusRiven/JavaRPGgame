This game will be grinding/farming (will try to make it as hack and slash) hell themed

Game will have 7 maps as layers of hell, there will be normal monsters, better versions of tchem (upgreaded in some way), and bosses at the end of each map (or something like that)

TODO:
-think about 3/4 (for now) classes for heroes u will be playing (and also make some skills that differ tchem from others)

-think of cool, fun and creative collecting system like gathering minerals for something
